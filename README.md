# haskell-inspired-arrow-json-parser
Trying to implement the initial version of https://github.com/tsoding/haskell-json as seen in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9RUqGYuGfw in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) with [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io).


This works for smallish Json Objects (but is quite slow) and StackOverflows for large Json Objects. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
